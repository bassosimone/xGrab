xGrab is a Direct Client-to-Client (DCC) downloader tool, with a
nice graphical user interface.  A command-line interface is available
as well, allowing for batch operations.

Direct Client-to-Client is an IRC-related sub-protocol enabling
peers to interconnect using an IRC server for handshaking in order
to exchange files or perform non-relayed chats.  For more on DCC,
see <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_Client-to-Client>.

xGrab is written in Python using Twisted and Pygtk: Twisted is a
popular framework for low-overhead event-based network applications,
while PyGtk is Python's Gtk+ bindings.

You can run xGrab directly from the sources using the following
convenience command::

	./bin/run-xgrab
